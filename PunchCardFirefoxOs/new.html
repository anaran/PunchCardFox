viewport allows you to control how mobile browsers will render your content.
width=device-width tells mobile browsers to render your content across the
full width of the screen, without being zoomed out (by default it would render
it at a desktop width, then shrink it to fit.)

Plus keeping your JavaScript separated from your HTML is always a good practice!

We're also using the 'defer' attribute. This allows us to tell the browser that
it should not wait for this file to load before continuing to load the rest of
resources in the page. Then, once everything has been loaded, it will parse and
execute the deferred files.
